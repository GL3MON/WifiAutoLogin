# WifiAutoLogin
This is a work-in-progress extension for skipping the painstaking process of typing in passwords and roll numbers.
It works but... It might be buggy and there is no styling(my bad).

# Setup
Clone this repository. Go to chrome://extensions and enable developer mode. Click on load unpacked and select the clones repository.

# Usage
Click on the extension to access the username and password setter form. (There is no NULL checking... Will be fixed soon... I am in middle of midterms right now and kinda speedran this extension).

# Future Updates
1) Styling the setter page
2) Adding Filter the inputs to prevent NULLs.
3) Providing better accessibility.

Anyways... See ya!!!
